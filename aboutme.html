          Nice to meet you anyone who's on my webpage. My name is Esther. I attend Palms Middle School as a 6th grader. 
          I play the violin and like math. My favorite place is Antelope Canyon and Lake Powell located in Arizona. 
          I sometimes don't like my life and I think it's pretty boring. Everyday, I want to change myself to a better person.
          I want to attend Stanford University and get my doctor's degree and be a pediatrician. I think kids need to be healthy
          to be a healthy person in the future. Or maybe I want to be a violinist. Who knows? Well thanks anyway for visiting my webpage.
